# FizzBuzz

Core:
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number
For the multiples of five print "Buzz" instead of the number For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
Extra:
make a new fizzbuzz file and make it functional make it so we we can decide which numbers to substitute for fizz and buzz using functions
Hint: loop, range, control flow

## Tutorial
- Created a for loop to go through number from 1-100
- Used the modulus operator so that if the remainder of the indexed number is 0 then it is a mutiple of 3 and 5 then it should print FizzBuzz
